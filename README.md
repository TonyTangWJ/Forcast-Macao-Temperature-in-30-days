   **2.4 Feature 'Humidity_Min' has several zero values. Substitute it by (2\*Humidity_Avg - Humidity_Max), and substitute the value lower than 20 to 20.
   **2.5 Convert 'Wind_Max' >= 50 to 50.
   **2.6 Convert 'Pressure_Avg' <27.3 to 27.3, and then convert Pressure_Min = 0 to the average of the other twoã€‚
